        <p class="text-justify">We at the Enstruman Dunyasi Group share our corporate philosophy “Sharing Passion & Performance,” and contribute to the enriched lifestyles of people while focusing our business on sound and music. With our brand promise “Make Waves” we capture
            those special moments when our customers’ hearts tremble. This brand promise is our pledge to our customers that we are committed to further promoting manufacturing that values the customers’ perspective, an approach we inherited and have
            followed since our foundation in 1887. In this way we provide products and services that resonate with customers. Enstruman Dunyasi has established its management vision “Becoming an Indispensable, Brilliantly Individual Company” that can
            “Boost brand power to become a highly profitable enterprise” as its future image in the medium to long term. Despite people’s lives becoming more convenient, as digital technologies accelerate and AI and IoT technologies progress, along with
            increased material wealth, people are seeking spiritual satisfaction and authenticity as well. In addition, people's lifestyles and values have changed dramatically due to the impact of COVID-19 and more people are feeling the importance of
            connecting with others. In response to these changes in the world, we are determined to respond to the needs of society by making various changes based on our strength of "technology and sensitivity" that we have cultivated in our origins
            of sound and music. We will continue to create new value and to propose lifetime value for each customer by developing closer ties with our customers. In January 2021, we established the Sustainability Committee and five working groups as
            an advisory body to the president in order to accelerate our efforts to realize a sustainable society. By integrating sustainability and management, we will contribute to society, while at the same time creating social value and enhancing
            corporate value. We at Enstruman Dunyasi Group want to be a company that supports the challenges and passion of each and every one of our customers. We will continue to make every effort to be a company that can meet everyone’s expectations.
            We look forward to having a long-lasting relationship, and greatly appreciate your ongoing support.
